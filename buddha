beliefs
short term: With the recent traversal of the underdark and seeing much that
reminds me of my heritage, I feel strongly compelled to seek out relics of my
culture that ideally don't try to take my soul.
long term: I miss the power I felt when I had fully stacked bracers of evil
spiderness, I will pursue it at *all* costs.

instincts:
- I am immensely focused when I backflip. I will be intently concentrated on
  executing it with grace and majesty.
